I am excited to take E155 this semester. I remember seeing the seniors going to lab for this class when I was a freshman. Now I am in my final year and feel I have a strong enough engineering background to take this course. I am excited to challenge myself. Most of all, I am excited to build the resilience and debugging skills that this course develops.

I found Lab 0 relatively easy. It allowed me to reflect on the Git, Linux, and Quarto familiarity that I've gained over the past year. I am not sure that I would have been able to set up this portfolio a year ago.
