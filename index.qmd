Bella Hottenrott is a senior Engineering major at Harvey Mudd College. Her background lies in electrical, computer, and controls engineering.
Over the weekends, she and her friends like to go surfing, hiking, and exploring in LA. When she has time to herself, she is almost certainly listening to a podcast, on a run, or making herself a coffee.
